# Code Test

> My approach to solve the [Everplans Mobile CodeTest](https://github.com/everplans/mobile-codetest/blob/main/CODETEST.md) with Swift.

## Getting Started

This app depends on the [Everplans Mobile CodeTest](https://github.com/everplans/mobile-codetest/blob/main/README.md) backend. 

## Prerequisites

- [Xcode 12](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

## Approach & Architecture

The app was built using SwiftUI and Combine. My choosen architecture pattern is MVVM. 

## Preview Layouts

All SwiftUI Views have Preview layouts available.


## Unit Tests

I included one Unit Test for the Feed List View Model to verify that the Feed returned is sorted.

* FeedListViewModelTests.swift
